You can buy upgrades, that locates behind your back, and boyscouts, grannies or houses will get x2 coins per second.
The goal is to collect 1 000 000 coins as fast as you can. The record is 155 seconds. 
Big granny, big boyscout and big house show how many coins you have to spend to buy another one granny, BS or house.
