# Locomotion Demo (Teleport Pins)

>"Ice Skaters" stage originally created by Susanne, retrofitted with additional teleport pins for VR. 
Features highlight animation and dynamic fadeIn/fadeOut of pins depending on player gaze

>Intent of this demo is to showcase a locomotion (movement) system commonly used for VR. Teleport pins allow creators to limit user exploration to pre-defined,
authored locations while preventing players to trail off.
